# Emotional Echoes - Mindfulness Tool MVP

A frontend-only React application that serves as an MVP for Emotional Echoes, an AI-inspired mindfulness tool. This project focuses on UI/UX and uses browser-based storage to demonstrate core functionality without a backend.

## Features

- **Mock Authentication Flow**: Basic sign-up and login functionality
- **Mood Tracking**: Record your mood with a slider and optional notes
- **Timeline Visualization**: View your mood history in a simple chart
- **AI Insights**: Mock intelligence that provides personalized suggestions
- **Guided Meditations**: Recommendations for mindfulness practices
- **Local Storage**: Your data persists across browser sessions
- **Notification System**: Reminders for daily mood checks

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository

## Project Structure

- **App.js**: Main application component with routing and state management
- **components.js**: All UI components for the application
- **styles.css**: Styling for the entire application
- **index.js** (not shown): Entry point that renders the App component

## Dependencies

## Data Management

All data is stored in the browser's localStorage. The application creates mock data for initial use and saves user entries locally, allowing for a realistic demonstration of the application's capabilities without a backend.

## Design Principles

- **Calm Aesthetics**: Soft colors and clean layouts to promote mindfulness
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Simple flows and clear calls-to-action
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and logical tab order

## Extending the Project

To extend this project for production:
1. Implement a proper backend API for data persistence
2. Add actual authentication with JWT or similar
3. Implement real AI analysis for personalized insights
4. Create a proper notification system
5. Add more detailed visualizations and reports
